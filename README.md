* ShCAD is a 2D CAD program written C++ using Qt framework. This project is just for fun and hobby. I always consider quality and try to code with design patterns. Already applied more than 17 design patterns ( Composite, Visitor, State, Facotry method, Memento, Command, Prototype, Builder, Flyweight, Strategy, Chain of responsibility, Singleton, Mediator, Observer, Template method, Decorator, etc).

* [Releases](https://github.com/hash1018/ShCAD/releases/tag/v0.1.1)

# Installation

# Windows
